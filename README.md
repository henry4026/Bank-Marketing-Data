## EDA and daily work

3. fixing imbalance dataset by doing oversampling and undersampling.
4. use gridsearch for tuning hyper parameter.
5. tuning model
## modeling.
1. use 3 different model: logistic regression, gradient boosting, random forest.
2. create roc cuver, compare the 3 different models with the AUC.
3. create confusion matrix, compare the 3 different models with cost benefit matrix.
## conclusion. 
1. logistic regression generate the most profit from cost benefit matrix.
